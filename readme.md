# Pokémon Access
# Version 2.3

## Introduction

The Pokemon access project is an improved version of the Pokecrystal Access Project, a set of scripts which initially provided access to Pokémon Crystal for people using a screen reader.
The goal of this project is to extend this functionality throughout all the Pokémon games. Current version has support for Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal, but in the future it will include, if it's possible, support for more games unified into this script.

At the momment, this readme will be essentially a copy of the readme provided with the Pokecrystal Access release, with only minnor  changes.

These scripts are designed to work with the VBA-ReRecording GameBoy emulator.
  
## Requirements and installation
1. Download the GameBoy emulator VBA Rerecording
http://vba-rerecording.googlecode.com/files/vba-v24m-svn-r480.7z

2. Get a compatible rom. Currently, the script supports the following:

-Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow: English, French, Spanish and Italian.
-Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal: English, Spanish and Italian.

3. After you have the desired rom, extract and run VBA.

4. Go to the Options menu, Head-Up Display, Show Speed, None (alt-o, h, s, enter)
Without this, NVDA reads the title bar every time it changes.

5. Optional but recommended: turn down the sound. In the Options menu, navigate to Audio, Volume (alt o, a, v)

## Starting the game
Each time you run VBA, you'll need to load the rom.
You can do this from the open dialog, or load a recent rom after you've opened it once.

Once the rom is loaded, load the lua script (tools, lua, New Lua script window).
From there, load pokemon.lua, press run. It should say ready (or your language equivalent, bassed on the game you've downloaded), alt tab out and back in again

## Keys
* Standard gameBoy keys: z/x are a/b, enter/backspace start/select and arrows.
* m - read current map name
* shift M - rename current map
* t - read text on screen, if any
* y - read current position
* h - read enemy health if in a battle
* r - read the surrounding tiles (for debugging purposes)

### Item/Object
* j, k and l - previous, current and next item
* shift k - rename current item
* p - pathfind. This tries to find a path between you and the object selected.
* Shift + P - Toggle HM compatibility when using pathfind. For example surf or cut
* i - walk to selected item. This tries to walk to the selected object.

### Camera
* s - move the camera left, stopping at walls
* f - move the camera right, stopping at walls
* e - move the camera up, stopping at walls
* c - move the camera down, stopping at walls
* d - move the camera to the player's position
* add shift to s/f/e/c to move the camera, ignoring walls
* Shift + y - read current camera position
* w - walk to camera. This tries to walk to camera's position.

### Gold/SILVER/Crystal exclusive keys
* shift+d - say which piece you are holding (on the unown puzzles)

## HackRom support
Current version of the script has extended support for hackroms of the games previously mentioned.
In the future, you'll have an in-game feature to tell the script if you are playing a hack or not. For now, you have to edit the file hacks.lua. You have to know  basic lua structures in order to do that.

Regarding "hacks.lua", keep in mind that...
{
-- base-game structure
  ["crystal"] = { -- base-game folder
-- hackrom structure
    [0x8447] = { -- rom hack checksum (you can get it on VBA-RR (file/rom information)
      game = "crystal-clear", -- script folder of the hack (can be the same as base-game)
      language = "en" -- language folder of the hack
    }, -- end hackrom structure
-- paste here previous structure if you want to add more hacks of Pokémon Crystal
  }, -- end base-game structure
  -- paste here previous structure if you want to add hacks of different games (gold, blue, yellow) changing the apropriate values
}


## Notes
New translations for the supported games are welcome. You should translate the files "maps.lua" and "sprites.lua" located on the game/[game]/[lang]  ([lang] can be any of the existing languages, choose which is better for you to translate from). You should translate asswell the file messages/[lang].lua (applies same rules). Once translated, you can send these files to me (or make a PR).

## Contact information
If you find a bug, or want to contact me about these scripts, my contact information is below.
for bugs, send a save state with instructions on how to reproduce the issue from it, whenever possible. You can save a named one with control shift s in the game.
